<h1>Buffy the Vampire Slayer - A CLI Mini-Game!</h1>

<p>Play as Buffy Summers in this <s>(extremely rudimentary)</s> game version of the TV show.</p>
<p>Buffy's best friend Willow Rosenberg has always been a bit of a wallflower. She doesn't have a lot of success at school in the romance department. That all changes once she meets a friendly guy named Malcolm on the internet. He's romantic, caring, and hopelessly devoted to her. But...is he also a 14th century demon unleashed to wreak havoc on the world wide web? Only you can uncover the truth! </p>

<h2>How to Install</h2>
<p>Fork and clone this repo</p>
<p>CD into this directory</p>
<p>'bundle install' to install all relevant files</p>
<p>'ruby bin/run.rb' to start the game.</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>

<p>Once you get started, you will make most choices via menu prompts or by pressing -enter- when the game instructs you to do so. 
Be sure to keep track of Buffy's health so it doesn't get too low. Different weapons will have different effects on your enemies.</p>

<h2>About/Credits</h2>
<p>I obviously do not own the rights to Buffy the Vampire Slayer (but it would be cool if I did). That's all Warner Brothers and the minds of Joss Whedon, Jane Espenson, and the other brilliant writers of the show. Please don't sue me, this is my homework! 

This app was created as part of a blog post for school. You can read about it here.

Images were taken from here and music from here. Thanks to the people who took the time to make these photos available, and thanks to the developers who made all of these sweet graphics for the original Game Boy game.
